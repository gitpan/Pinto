DESCRIPTION
    Pinto is a suite of tools for creating and managing a CPAN-like
    repository of Perl archives. Pinto is inspired by CPAN::Mini,
    CPAN::Mini::Inject, and MyCPAN::App::DPAN, but adds a few interesting
    features:

    *   Pinto supports several usage patterns

        With Pinto, you can create a repository to mirror the latest
        distributions from another repository. Or you can create a "sparse
        repository" with just your own private distributions. Or you can
        create a "project repository" that has all the distributions
        required for a particular project. Or you can combine all of the
        above in some way.

    *   Pinto supports adding AND removing archives from the repository.

        Pinto gives you the power to precisely tune the contents of your
        repository. So you can be sure that your downstream clients get
        exactly the stack of dependencies that you want them to have.

    *   Pinto can be integrated with your version control system.

        Pinto can automatically commit to your version control system
        whenever the contents of the repository changes. This gives you
        repeatable and identifiable snapshots of your dependencies, and a
        mechanism for rollback when things go wrong.

    *   Pinto makes it easier to build several local repositories.

        Creating new Pinto repositories is easy, and each has its own
        configuration. So you can have different repositories for each
        department, or each project, or each version of perl, or each
        customer, or whatever you want.

    *   Pinto can pull archives from multiple remote repositories.

        Pinto can mirror or import distributions from multiple sources, so
        you can create private (or public) networks of repositories that
        enable separate teams or individuals to collaborate and share
        distributions.

    *   Pinto supports team development.

        Pinto is suitable for small to medium-sized development teams, where
        several developers might contribute new distributions at the same
        time.

    *   Pinto has a robust command line interface.

        The pinto-admin and pinto-remote command line tools have options to
        control every aspect of your Pinto repository. They are well
        documented and behave in a DWIM fashion.

    *   Pinto can be extended.

        You can extend Pinto by creating Pinto::Action subclasses to perform
        new operations on your repository, such as extracting documentation
        from a distribution, or grepping the source code of several
        distributions.
