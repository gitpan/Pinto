=head1 STUFF TODO

In no particular order...

=over 4

=item Enable plugins for visiting and filtering. See CPAN::Mini and
CPAN::Mini::Visit.

=item Automatically fetch dependecies when adding *VERY COOL*

=item Make file/directory permissions configurable

=item Standardize API, using named parameters except where it makes
sense not to.

=item Add a lock mechanism, so multiple processes don't mess with the
same repository at the same time.  See Proc::Pidfile, Proc::Pid::File,
etc. ++

=item Replace the IndexManager and Index classes with a proper
database.  Look at CPANDB for example.  Estimate benefits for George.  ??

=item Use proper exceptions, instead of just croaking.  ++

=item Consider how we might mirror multiple repositories.

=item Write a tutorial to explain different ways for using Pinto in
the development/deployment cycle. ++

=item Add support for cpan[1] clients.  For this I think we just need
to produce minimal version of the authors and modules index files. ++

=item Re-think the pinto-admin command line interface.  Should we
just make all the options global, instead of having options for
each subcommand?

=item Add feature for listing just the locally added packages. ++

=item Generate a RECENT file.  This could just contain the files
added in the last action (if any).

=item Add feature for listing local packages that are outdated
(i.e. there is a newer mirrored version). ++

=item Implement Pinto::Store::Git.

=item Improve Perl::Critic compliance.

=item Document, document, document.

=item Tests, tests, tests.

=item Look for better ways to use Moose roles.

=item Daemonize Pinto::Server.  See MooseX::Daemonize

=item Look into using Path::Class::SVN or Alien::SVN instead of using
my home-grown interface to Subversion.

=item Consider using MooseX::Params::Validate on methods.

=item Profile and look for performance optimizations.
