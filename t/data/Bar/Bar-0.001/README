NAME
    Pinto - Perl distribution repository manager

VERSION
    version 0.012

SYNOPSIS
    You probably want to look at the documentation for pinto-admin. All the
    modules in this distribution are private (for now). So the API
    documentation is purely for my own reference. But this document does
    explain what Pinto does and why it exists, so feel free to read on
    anyway.

METHODS
  create()
    Creates a new empty repository.

  mirror()
    Populates your repository with the latest version of all distributions
    found in the foreign repository (which is usually a CPAN mirror). Your
    locally added distributions will always mask those mirrored from the
    remote repository.

  add(dists => ['YourDist.tar.gz'], author => 'SOMEONE')
  remove(packages => ['Some::Package'], author => 'SOMEONE')
  clean()
  list()
  verify()
DISCUSSION
    Pinto is a set of tools for creating and managing a CPAN-style
    repository. This repository can contain just your own private
    distributions, or you can fill it with the latest ones from a CPAN
    mirror, or both. You can then use your favorite CPAN client to fetch
    distributions from your repository and install them as you normally
    would.

    Pinto shares a lot of DNA with CPAN::Site, CPAN::Mini, and
    CPAN::Mini::Inject. But I wasn't entirely satisfied with those, so I
    built a (hopefully better) mousetrap.

    Pinto is not magic pixie dust though. It does not guarantee that you
    will always have a working stack of distributions. It is still up to you
    to figure out what to put in your repository. Pinto just gives you a set
    of tools for doing that in a controlled manner.

    This is a work in progress. Comments, criticisms, and suggestions are
    always welcome. Feel free to contact "thaljef@cpan.org".

WHY IS IT CALLED "Pinto"
    The term "CPAN" is heavily overloaded. In some contexts, it means the
    CPAN module or the cpan utility. In other contexts, it means a mirror
    like <http://cpan.perl.org> or a web site like <http://search.cpan.org>.

    I wanted to avoid all that confusion, so I picked a name that has no
    connection to "CPAN" at all. "Pinto" is a nickname that I sometimes call
    my son, Wesley.

THANKS
    Randal Schwartz - for pioneering the first mini CPAN back in 2002
    Ricardo Signes - for creating CPAN::Mini, which inspired much of Pinto
    Shawn Sorichetti & Christian Walde - for creating CPAN::Mini::Inject
    George Hartzell @ Genentech - for sponsoring this project
