     * Bug Fixes:

     The 'add' and 'remove' commands for pinto-admin were not reading
     arguments from STDIN properly.

     All svn commands would fail when running under pinto-server.
     This was due to some strage behavior in IPC::Run that I can't
     explain.

     Now using IPC::Run to handle external commands (like svn).
     IPC::Run seems to behave better when running in a server
     environment like pinto-server (via Dancer).

    * Interface Changes:

    pinto-admin[1] is now zero-conf (at least, by default).  However,
    you must now specify the --repos for every command.  Also, some of
    the options for pinto-admin have been removed for safety, and are
    now in the repository-specific configuration file (see below).
    This helps to deter you from doing things that contradict the
    usual behavior of your repository.

    Each Pinto repository now has its own configuration file, which
    governs its basic behavior.  The configuration file is generated
    with default values when you run the "create" command.  This
    allows you set up multiple repositories, each with a different
    behavior and VCS store.

    * Enhancements:

    The "add" and "remove" commands for pinto-admin[1] can now read
    arguments from STDIN.  When doing so, it filters out things that
    look like comments and blank lines.  This makes it easy to pipe in
    the output from a find[1] or dzil[1] command.

    You can also specify arguments to the "add" command as URLs,
    and Pinto will fetch them for you. (Suggested by Tim Bunce).

    The "list" command now accepts a --type option, which will show
    you either all packages, only local packages, only foreign
    packages, or only local packages that block a foreign package.
    (suggested by George Hartzell and Meg Green).

    The "add", "remove", and "mirror" actions now accept a --message
    option, which will be prepended to the VCS commit log that Pinto
    generates (suggested by Jan Vogel).

    Added "nocolor" command line option.

    Removed bin/pinto-client.  That wasn't supposed to be in there,
    damnit!  Look for the Pinto-Remote distribution instead.

    * No interface changes or bug fixes.

    * Internal Changes:

    Improved exception handling.

    Pinto now uses a lock file to synchronize concurrent actions in
    the repository.  Only one actor is allowed to operate in a given
    repository at a time.  Others have to wait until they can get the
    lock, or timeout after about 60 seconds.

    * No interface changes or bug fixes.

    * Internal Changes:

    Several modules have been moved out to the Pinto-Common
    distribution.  This is to allow sharing between Pinto,
    Pinto::Server, and Pinto::Remote without requiring direct
    dependency on all of Pinto (including it's dependencies).

    * Bug Fixes:

    Pinto::TestLogger didn't end with a true value.  Thank you, CPAN
    Testers!

    * Internal Changes:

    Switched from IPC::Cmd to Proc::Reliable for running shell
    commands. IPC::Cmd seems to do funky things with STDIN
    and STDOUT that don't set well with CGI.

    You can specify an output filehandle or a buffer (as a scalar
    reference) where you want the output from Pinto::list() to
    go.

    The output from the List action contains the name, version,
    and location in each package, rather than just the name.  This
    was a regression in the last version.

    * Other Changes:

    pinto-server[1], pinto-client[1], and all the Pinto::Server::*
    modules have been pulled out into a separate distribtuion,
    which will be released to CPAN shortly.

    * Bug Fixes:

    Fixed our call to File::Copy::copy() to accommodate older versions
    which did not handle Path::Class objects properly.  Thank you,
    CPAN Testers!

0.010     2011-08-14 13:29:23 America/Los_Angeles

    * Bug Fixes:

    Fixed test failures that I introduced by renaming some classes in
    the last release.

    * Interface changes:

    pinto[1] is now called pinto-admin[1].  It still has all the same
    options and arguments.  Likewise, App::Pinto is now
    App::Pinto::Admin.

    With pinto-admin, the "mirror" parameter is now called "source".
    This reflects the fact that your dists don't necessarily have to
    come from a CPAN mirror.  They just have to come from some place
    that conforms to the CPAN structure.  Do not confuse this with 
    the "mirror" command, which still does actually mirror the
    aforementioned "source".

    * Other changes:

    Revised documentation.

    Added some basic functional tests.

    Created pinto-server and pinto-client, for using Pinto across a
    nework. These are still very experimental.

    Once again, a lot of the internals have been rewritten.  But the
    guts of Pinto are all private (for now), so you shouldn't really
    care.

0.008     2011-08-09 14:47:02 America/Los_Angeles

    * Interface changes:

    The 'author' parameter is now entirely optional.  It defaults to
    your shell username, if we can figure that out.  If not, then an
    exception is thrown, and you'll have to set the 'author' parameter
    explicitly.

    pinto[1] now has --notag, --nocommit, and --noinit options.  All
    these can also be set in your configuration file.  See the
    pinto[1] documentation for details.

    * Other changes:

    The internals of Pinto have been substantially rewritten to
    improve performance and readability of the code.  The Pinto API is
    still considered alpha, and subject to change.

0.007     2011-08-04 08:04:27 America/Los_Angeles

    * Interface Changes:

    A config file for pinto[1] is no longer mandatory. If you do not
    have one, then you'll have to specify all required parameters on
    the command line (this is usually just the '--local' and sometimes
    the '--author' options).  If you don't specify these, you'll get a
    really ugly stack trace from Moose.  I'll look into making these
    error messages prettier in a future release.  Thanks to b.jakubski
    for suggesting this change.

    * Bug Fixes:

    RT #70015: Can't create repository.  The 'create' command failed
    because the 02packages file could not be read.  This has now been
    remedied.

    * Other Changes:
    
    Edited documenation for pinto[1]

    Major overhaul of internals.  But the pinto[1] command line
    interface is mostly the same.
