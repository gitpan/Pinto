=head1 NAME

App::Pinto::Admin::Command::purge - remove all distributions from the repository

=head1 VERSION

version 0.032

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pinto-admin --root=/some/dir purge

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command removes all distributions from the repository.  There is
no automated way to undo this.  But if you are using a VCS-based
store, you can use VCS commands directly to roll back the state of the
repository.

=head1 COMMAND ARGUMENTS

None

=head1 COMMAND OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --message=MESSAGE

Prepends the MESSAGE to the VCS log message that L<Pinto> generates.
This is only relevant if you are using a VCS-based storage mechanism
for L<Pinto>.

=item --nocommit

Prevents L<Pinto> from committing changes in the repository to the VCS
after the operation.  This is only relevant if you are
using a VCS-based storage mechanism.  Beware this will leave your
working copy out of sync with the VCS.  It is up to you to then commit
or rollback the changes using your VCS tools directly.  Pinto will not
commit old changes that were left from a previous operation.

=item --noinit

Prevents L<Pinto> from pulling/updating the repository from the VCS
before the operation.  This is only relevant if you are using a
VCS-based storage mechanism.  This can speed up operations
considerably, but should only be used if you *know* that your working
copy is up-to-date and you are going to be the only actor touching the
Pinto repository within the VCS.

=item --tag=NAME

Instructs L<Pinto> to tag the head revision of the repository at NAME.
This is only relevant if you are using a VCS-based storage mechanism.
The syntax of the NAME depends on the type of VCS you are using.
